A tiny wordle player and solver written in C.

Two executables are available: wordle, a standalone, terminal (non-graphical) 
player, solver and stats generator for 5 letters words, and server, an http 
server for an html wordle solver suitable for desktop (tested on linux), tablet 
(tested on iPad) and phone (tested on iPhone).

Those executables depend only on standard C libraries, posix librarues and for 
server on microhttpd, which should guarantee portability on a large number of 
systems.
